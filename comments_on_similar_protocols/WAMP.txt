WAMP, I have also given some thoughts to adding layers to the WS protocol for RPC, broadcast,
group delivery, user list delivery.  In general I think your trying to do to much stuff in your
WAMP protocol and that the next layer on top of WS should only contain routing information, and not
deal with the data formating of the other message data.  I also think this routing information
should be stored in the payload section of the WS message, and also potentially be stored in
extension headers (an client optional optimization, compatible with per message compression, deflation).  
   I think this will provide better universally compatible standard long term, that will 
also stay backward compatible with original WS (version null) implementations.   I also think 
it will focus the protocol implementations leaving other softer implementation details choices to other protocol layers 
(so that others can branch as desired and or necessary).   I am trying to 
do something with this narrowed routing information only scope in the taxi.adligo.org project (sometime in the future).
  In other words, 
  I wouldn't want to jump into usage of a implementation that is having trouble getting comments.
  Self-Healing/Failover seems to be or is this what you meant by federation?
